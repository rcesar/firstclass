* **Typography**
    Fonts, Web Fonts, Header, and many ideas.

For Contributors
----------------

Feel like you've got an idea on how to optimize the code and want to share it? We are totally open to new changes, however this is one of the first publically available plugins that I am offering and therefore do not have an exact process on pull requests. Feel free to fork the project all you want, but be aware any pull requests that are made may take a while to get implemented (if at all).

## Getting started

Download the [latest release][5] or clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/WDSIGN/firstClass.git`.

## Bug tracker

Report bugs on [firstClass Issues][6].

## Developers

First of all, install [Node][7]. We use [Grunt][8] to build firstClass. If you haven't used Grunt before, you need to install the `grunt-cli` package as a global install.

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

If you haven't done so already, clone the UIkit git repo.

```
git clone git://github.com/wdsign/firstclass.git
```
Install the Node dependencies.

```
cd firstClass
npm install
```

Run `grunt` build and minify the release.

```
grunt
```

The built version of firstClass will be put in the `/assets` subdirectory.

Enter the following, so Grunt will watch your working directory and compile LESS files automatically everytime you hit save.

```
grunt watch
```
